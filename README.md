# AutobahnJS "Built"

This repository contains the built and released versions of [AutobahnJS](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnJS) ready for use in your project. This is a clone of CrossBar's Bower autobahn-js-built project that I've pushed to the npm repo.

## Using with npm

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

	npm install autobahn-js-built

Add a `<script>` tag to your `index.html`:

	<script src="/node_modules/autobahn-js-built/autobahn.min.js"></script>
